        programmable, and auditable funding system for core protocol work. Its architecture draws on <strong>best
          practices in open governance, audited smart contracts, and empirical evidence</strong> accumulated over nearly a
        decade of EVM-based DAO evolution — while preserving ETC's fixed monetary policy, Proof-of-Work consensus, and
        ECIP upgrade process. Olympia introduces no inflation, no new token, and retains a governance model that is
        open, sybil-resistant, and accountable to the ecosystem.
      </p>
    
      <h4 class="subheader">What Olympia Makes Possible</h4>
      <p>
        Instead of altering ETC's monetary policy or block rewards, Olympia redirects value that would be burned on
        other EVM chains into a shared on-chain public-goods treasury governed through a modular DAO framework and a
        standardized funding proposal process. Olympia advances the community's original 2016 commitment — expressed in
        the <a href="https://ethereumclassic.org/blog/2016-08-13-declaration-of-independence" target="_blank">
          Ethereum Classic Declaration of Independence</a> — that the chain remain sovereign, censorship-resistant, and
        free from third-party control. With EVM compatibility enabling modern governance tooling and DAO workflows,
        Ethereum Classic can now <strong>stand on its own — transparently funded, independent by design, and resilient
          against corporate capture or governance shortcuts</strong>.

            Activates EIP-1559-style fee mechanics and introduces the <code>BASEFEE</code> opcode (EIP-3198),
            improving EVM compatibility and fee predictability. On Ethereum Classic, the <code>BASEFEE</code>
            is <strong>not burned</strong>; instead, 100% is redirected at the consensus layer to the Olympia

            Defines an optional governance-layer mechanism for smoothing Treasury-held BASEFEE over time using a

        Together, these ECIPs form the Olympia framework — a modular, upgrade-friendly funding layer that gives
        Ethereum Classic a reliable, transparent, and decentralized mechanism to sustain clients and public goods.
        Only minimal consensus changes are required (ECIP-1111), while all governance, proposal processing, and
        allocation logic operate in the contract layer where they can evolve safely over time. This architecture
        preserves Ethereum Classic's foundational guarantees — <strong>immutability, permissionlessness, censorship
          resistance, Proof-of-Work security, and decentralized governance</strong> — while enabling long-term,
        sustainable ecosystem development.

    <!-- ABOUT ETC & OLYMPIA -->
    <section id="about">
      <h3>About Ethereum Classic &amp; the Olympia Upgrade</h3>

      <p>
        Ethereum Classic is the original Ethereum chain, rooted in the <strong>Code is Law</strong> philosophy,
        Proof-of-Work security, and a long-standing commitment to immutability, neutrality, and open participation.
        Throughout its history, ETC has chosen to preserve chain integrity and resist governance shortcuts — even when
        that meant fewer resources or slower development — in order to uphold its foundational principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Olympia builds on these principles rather than altering them. It introduces a transparent, on-chain funding
        layer for client maintenance, public goods, and ecosystem growth, all while preserving ETC’s fixed monetary
        policy, Proof-of-Work consensus, and the ECIP upgrade process. Olympia does not rewrite history, add
        inflation, or shift protocol governance into a token-voting model. Instead, it provides the sustainable,
        decentralized funding infrastructure needed for Ethereum Classic to remain a secure, credible, and independent
        Proof-of-Work smart contract platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site presents a high-level overview of the Olympia framework. The full, canonical specifications are
        published in the official Ethereum Classic <a href="https://ecips.ethereumclassic.org" target="_blank">ECIP</a>
        repository and serve as the authoritative reference for
        implementers, auditors, and ecosystem builders.
